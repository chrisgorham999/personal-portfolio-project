        Welcome to my personal portfolio page! A little bit about me: I was born and raised in Somersworth, New Hampshire. My first computer was a Commodore 64 at age 12 and I started coding in BASIC at age 13. In my high school years, I self-taught myself HTML and began making websites for friends and family. I also studied Visual Basic and made small games and applications in my spare time.
        </p>
        <p>
        Growing up, I was fascinated with the military and the idea of service. Just before my Senior year of high school I decided to enlist in the Navy and left for boot camp the day after I graduated high school. I didn't join with the intention of making it a career but I enjoyed it so much that I decided to stay for 21 years. The Navy brought me all over the world - 41 countries total - including living overseas in Japan for three years. My favorite destinations were Paris, Bangkok, and Malta. I retired from the Navy in May of 2022.
        </p>    
        
        <p>In retirement, I've started coding again as a student at Bellevue University in their Web Development degree program. </p>

        <p>I'm married and have two children (a 4 year old daughter and a 9 month old son). In my spare time I like to run, make games in JavaScript or Visual Basic, and dabble in cryptocurrency.</p><br><br>
